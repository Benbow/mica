"1";"UKB";"UK Biobank: a large-scale prospective epidemiological resource";"Scientists have known for many years that our risks of developing different diseases are due to the complex interplay of different factors: our lifestyle and environment; our personal susceptibility (genes); and the play of chance (luck). But, despite this longstanding awareness, a clear picture of the combined effects of different factors on the risks of different diseases in different circumstances is yet to emerge. Cohorts to date have typically been characterized by small numbers of disease cases (which may yield unstable estimates due to random variations); incomplete or inadequate measures of potential risk factors (which may yield systematic under-estimates of disease associations); incomplete or inadequate measures of confounding factors (which may yield over- or under-estimates); and/or retrospective case-control designs in which the disease itself may influence risk factor levels (i.e. ""reverse causality""). Consequently, to help assess the main causes of various chronic diseases quantitatively, there is now a strategic need to establish some large blood-based prospective epidemiological studies in a range of settings with prolonged and detailed follow-up of cause-specific morbidity and mortality.
The UK Biobank resource aims to include 500,000 people from all around Great Britain who are currently aged 40-69. This age group is being studied because it involves people at risk over the next few decades of developing a wide range of important diseases (including cancer, hear disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia). The UK National Health Service treats the single largest group of people anywhere in the world, and keeps detailed records on all of them from birth to death. Consequently, prolonged follow-up of participants through routine medical and other health-related records will allow the identification of comparatively large numbers of individuals who develop each of a wide range of disabling and life-threatening conditions. Because UK Biobank will involve extensive baseline questionnaire and physical measures, as well as stored blood and urine samples that allow many different types of assay (e.g. genetic, proteomic, metabonomic, biochemical and haematologic) it will be a uniquely rich resource for investigating why some people develop particular diseases while others do not. This will help researchers to understand the causes of diseases better, and to find new ways to prevent and treat many different conditions.";"http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk";"profiles/mica_demo/demo_consortium_data/UKB_logo.gif";"Tim Peakman (UK Biobank)|Andrew Trehearne (UK Biobank)|Tim Sprosen (UK Biobank)";"Paul Elliott (Imperial College London)|John Gallacher (Cardiff University)|Paul Burton (University of Leicester)|Jill Pell (University of Glasgow)|Valerie Beral (University of Oxford)|Tim Sprosen (University of Oxford)|Tim Peakman (UK Biobank)|Alan Silman (University of Manchester)|Rory Collins (University of Oxford)";"500000";"500000";"http://www.p3gobservatory.org/catalogue.htm?studyId=30"
"4";"LifeLines";"LifeLines Cohort Study & Biobank";"Multifactorial diseases are by definition the result of multiple risk factors that are both genetically and environmentally determined. Multifactorial diseases may have more in common than generally recognized, since some risk factors are associated with multiple diseases, suggesting an individual susceptibility for specific risk factors. 
Since different diseases share identical risk factors, it is clear that an exclusive focus on associations between single risk factors and single outcomes will not unravel the unresolved issues of aetiology and individual prognosis of multifactorial diseases. Instead, research has to focus on the underlying mechanisms why individuals with similar (established) risk factors develop different diseases, i.e. the modification of the universal risk factors for multiple disorders.
Overall aim of the study:
Unravel the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in the development of multifactorial diseases, their concurrent development in individuals and their complications as a complex trait.
Primary objectives:
Which are the disease overriding risk factors which predict the development of a multifactorial disease during lifetime? How are these universal risk factors modified, or what determines the effect of a universal risk factor in an individual? Specific research questions will focus on risk factors and modifiers (genetic, environmental and combined or complex factors) for single and multiple diseases. In addition to co-morbidity, LifeLines focuses on co-determinants. The primary endpoints include measures of ageing, metabolic and endocrine diseases, cardiology, renal diseases, pulmonary and musculoskeletal diseases, and psychopathology.
Secondary objectives:
Secondary aims include the assessment of the prevalence and incidence of multifactorial diseases and their risk factors in individuals as well as in families. The burden of disease for the society will be quantified in terms of care needed, and total costs of care.";"http://www.lifelines.net";"profiles/mica_demo/demo_consortium_data/lifelines.png";"Bruce H.R.

"3";"LifeGene";"LifeGene";"LifeGene is a Swedish population-based prospective cohort study on lifestyle, health and genomics. Our intention is, using existing national resources, e.g. the Swedish Twin Registry and Multiple Generation Register, as a springboard, to develop the infrastructure to initiate a large, genetically informative prospective cohort. Because of its prospective design, LifeGene goes several steps further than current collections of samples that may be limited to specific geographical regions of Sweden, specific ascertainment schemes or limited by size.
The ultimate objective of LifeGene health is to improve public health through providing an open resource to researchers. There will be a focus on disease etiology and everyday health problems. Growing health concerns, e.g. obesity, diabetes, allergies, psychiatric disorders, will be addressed. Susceptibility to common infections and the underlying mechanisms for infections being risk factors in development of chronic disease will be studied. Study features will be:
- Ascertaining a cohort of at least ½ million Swedes, potentially starting with all first degree relatives of the twins in the Swedish Twin Registry;
- Repeated assessment of in depth exposure information through electronic means (web, cell-phones, digital paper and TV, etc);
- Repeated surveillance of morbidity through electronic means, including algorithm based assessment of diagnoses for outcomes not typically reported in national health registers, quality registers or ascertained via hospital discharge (e.g. acute infections, psychiatric disorders, allergy, IBS);
- Linkage with all available sources of medical record information (inpatient registry, cancer registry, and when possible, through primary care records);
- Collection of DNA and serum/plasma from all members of the cohort at initiation;
- Collection of other tissues (whole blood, serum/plasma, CSF, skin biopsies, etc.) as specific research questions dictate.";"http://www.lifegene.se";"profiles/mica_demo/demo_consortium_data/lifegene.png";"Helena Andersson (Karolinska Institute)|Jan-Eric Litton (Karolinska Institute)";"Nancy Pedersen (Karolinska Institute)|Jan-Eric Litton (Karolinska Institute)";"500000";;"http://www.p3gobservatory.org/catalogue.htm?studyId=21"
"2";"KORA-gen";"KORA-gen - Cooperative health research in the Region of Augsburg";"Helmholtz Zentrum München – the German Research Center for Environmental Health has established the population-based KORA-gen Biobank. It is based on the KORA research platform (Cooperative health research in the Region of Augsburg, Southern Germany) which has evolved from the WHO MONICA study (Monitoring of Trends and Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease). 
In total, four population based health surveys have been conducted between 1984 and 2000 with 18.000 participants in the age of 25 to 74 years, and a biological specimen bank was established in order to enable the researchers to perform epidemiologic research with respect to molecular and genetic factors. The KORA study center conducts regular follow-up investigations and has collected a wealth of information on sociodemography, general medical history, environmental factors, smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, and various laboratory parameters.
In KORA-gen the following prerequisites for successful genetic-epidemiological research are fulfilled: 
▪ sufficiently large number of participants,
▪ well characterized disease phenotypes and intermediate phenotypes,
▪ information about environmental factors,
▪ availability of genomic DNA, serum, plasma and urine, as well as EBV immortalized cell lines.";"http://epi.gsf.de/kora-gen/index_e.php";"profiles/mica_demo/demo_consortium_data/kora.png";"Erich Wichmann (Institute of Epidemiology)|Christian Gieger (Institute of Epidemiology)";"Erich Wichmann (Institute of Epidemiology)";"18000";;"http://www.p3gobservatory.org/catalogue.htm?studyId=86"

HUNT 1 was carried out in 1984-1986 to establish the health history of 75,000 persons;
HUNT 2 was carried out to study the evolution of the health history of 74,000 persons in 1995-1997, including blood sample collection from 65,000 persons organised in a biobank database containing genetic information.
The focus regarding BBMRI is on HUNT 2.
The main objectives in HUNT 2 were the major public health issues as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obstructive lung disease, osteoporosis and mental health, in concordance with current priorities of the health authorities.";"http://www.hunt.ntnu.no/index.php?side=english";"profiles/mica_demo/demo_consortium_data/hunt.png";"Kristian Hveem (HUNT Research Centre)|Jostein Holmen (HUNT Research Centre)";"Kristian Hveem (HUNT Research Centre)|Jostein Holmen (HUNT Research Centre)";"66140";"65000";"http://www.p3gobservatory.org/catalogue.htm?studyId=78"
