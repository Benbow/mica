"Genome partitioning of genetic variation for complex traits using common SNPs";"Peter Visscher and colleagues report an analysis to partition the genetic variation for several complex traits onto chromosome segments and find that the variation explained is approximately proportional to the total length of genes included within a chromosome segment. They estimate that ~45%, ~17%, ~25% and ~21% of the phenotypic variation, respectively, for height, body mass index, von Willebrand factor and QT interval is tagged by common SNPs, and they partition this variation by chromosome and chromosome segments.";"10.1038/ng.823";"http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ng/rss/aop/~3/jISIQMYjmNo/ng.823"
"Beyond Missing Heritability: Prediction of Complex Traits";"Despite rapid advances in genomic technology, our ability to account for phenotypic variation using genetic information remains limited for many traits. This has unfortunately resulted in limited application of genetic data towards preventive and personalized medicine, one of the primary impetuses of genome-wide association studies. Recently, a large proportion of the “missing heritability” for human height was statistically explained by modeling thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms concurrently. However, it is currently unclear how gains in explained genetic variance will translate to the prediction of yet-to-be observed phenotypes. Using data from the Framingham Heart Study, we explore the genomic prediction of human height in training and validation samples while varying the statistical approach used, the number of SNPs included in the model, the validation scheme, and the number of subjects used to train the model. In our training datasets, we are able to explain a large proportion of the variation in height (h2 up to 0.83, R2 up to 0.96). However, the proportion of variance accounted for in validation samples is much smaller (ranging from 0.15 to 0.36 depending on the degree of familial information used in the training dataset). While such R2 values vastly exceed what has been previously reported using a reduced number of pre-selected markers (<0.10), given the heritability of the trait (∼0.80), substantial room for improvement remains.";"10.1371/journal.pgen.1002051";"http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosgenetics/NewArticles/~3/Wlj5hw3FTG8/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002051"
"Genomic contributions to Mendelian disease";"Genomic research has two quite distinct faces. On the one hand, it produces large, curated, reference data sets through numerous networks of investigators for community use—although this aspect has great and widespread utility, it does not inspire per se. On the other hand, it allows an unbiased genome-wide view that is exciting precisely because it habitually uncovers biology that we were hopelessly ignorant about. Consequently, I am sanguine that the search for Mendelian disease genes by exomic and genomic sequencing will produce more than a long and comprehensive list of genes and associated disease mutations. Importantly, we are likely to hear new and surprising biological stories. Human geneticists have long devoted their energies to understanding, diagnosing, and treating disorders that display a clear and Mendelian (i.e., single-gene) pattern of inheritance. Nevertheless, as Victor McKusick showed through painstaking cataloging, this list of genetic disorders is neither small nor based on extensive genetic evidence ( McKusick 1998). Mendelian inheritance of rare traits and diseases has defined patterns of segregation with well-defined quantitative risks of recurrence; but the vast majority of McKusick's entries are based on astute clinical observations of a handful of patients, not extensive quantitative analysis. In other words, in McKusick's catalog, the many rare disorders and syndromes are good hypotheses, not proven examples, of 'Mendelian Inheritance in Man.' This is precisely the situation where a genomic approach is desirable.";"10.1101/gr.123554.111";"http://genome.cshlp.org/cgi/content/full/21/5/643?rss=1"
