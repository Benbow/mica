# [Mica 7.x](http://www.obiba.org/node/174) [![Build Status](http://ci.obiba.org/view/Mica/job/Mica%207.x/badge/icon)](http://ci.obiba.org/view/Mica/job/Mica%207.x/)

[Mica](http://www.obiba.org/node/174) is a powerful software application used to create web portals for epidemiological
study consortia.

Using Mica, consortia can build personalised web sites for publishing their research activities and their membership.
Mica includes many domain-specific features such as study catalogues, data dictionary browsers, on-line data access request
forms, community tools (forums, events, news) and others. Moreover, Mica includes a powerful data search engine that allows
authenticated researchers to perform distributed queries on the content of each individual study data collection hosted
by the OBiBa [Opal](http://www.obiba.org/node/63) database software.

Mica is based on the content management software [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) used by millions of websites worldwide.
As such, a webmaster benefits from all the power and flexibility of Drupal, as well as the support of an extended developer community.

Mica is developped by [OBiBa](http://www.obiba.org).
