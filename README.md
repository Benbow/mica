=================

[Mica](http://www.obiba.org/node/174) is a powerful software application used to create web portals for epidemiological study consortia.

Using [Mica](http://www.obiba.org/node/174), consortia can build personalised web sites for publishing their research activities and their membership.
[Mica](http://www.obiba.org/node/174) includes many domain-specific features such as study catalogues, data dictionary browsers, on-line data access request forms, community tools (forums, events, news) and others. Moreover, [Mica](http://www.obiba.org/node/174) includes a powerful data search engine
that allows authenticated researchers to perform distributed queries on the content of each individual study data collection hosted by the OBiBa [Opal](http://www.obiba.org/node/63) database software.

[Mica](http://www.obiba.org/node/174) is based on the content management software [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) used by millions of websites worldwide. As such, a webmaster benefits from all the power and flexibility of [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org), as well as the support of an extended developer community.

[Mica](http://www.obiba.org/node/174) is developped by [OBiBa](http://www.obiba.org).
