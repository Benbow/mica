"The Health of the Older Women in Accra, Ghana: Results of the Women's Health Study of Accra";21695397;;;"The health of women residing in the developing countries is not limited to reproductive health conditions or infectious diseases. While these illnesses remain serious threats to a healthy life, as the population ages, the prevalence of illnesses considered to be of significance only in industrialized nations also increasingly afflicts the residents of the developing worlds. The health and well-being of the older women was evaluated in the 2003 Women's Health Study of Accra. This community based survey and clinical and laboratory examination of 1,328 women identified a significantly high prevalence of malaria and chronic, non-communicable diseases in all age groups without regard to education level or income. Hypertension, diabetes and obesity are significantly prevalent in women age 50 years and older. The prevalence of conditions which adversely affect health and quality of life, including impaired visual acuity, poor dentition, pain and limitations with mobility is significant in the women age 50 years and older. While these data are specific to Ghana, they have the potential to be generalizable to women in other urban areas in transition. As the life expectancy is increasing in developing countries, an increased awareness and treatment of chronic health conditions in the older women is critical to ensure a healthy life as they enter their golden years.";"Duda RB|Anarfi JK|Adanu RM|Seffah J|Darko R|Hill AG";"J Cross Cult Gerontol. 2011 Jun 22"
"Associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene with adiponectin levels and cardio-metabolic risk factors in patients with cancer";21694446;"http://iospress.metapress.com/content/105291/";"Diseases Markers";"Objectives: The aims of this study are to (1) study the influence of polymorphisms in adiponectin gene on adiponectin levels and potential associations with breast, prostate and colon cancer; (2) investigate the associations of adiponectin levels with other adipokines and breast, prostate and colon cancers. Subjects: We measured fasting adiponectin, leptin, insulin, Sex steroids in 132 (66 females, 66 males) cancer patients and 68 age and sex matched apparently healthy subjects. Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference were used as indices of obesity. Insulin Resistance was assessed using Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA). Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP rs182052 (G-10066-A), SNP rs1501299 (276G > T), SNP rs224176 (45T > G) in adiponectin gene were studied using Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. Results: GG genotype of SNP rs1501299 was significantly associated with higher levels of adiponectin (OR=1.2, 95%CI(1.03-1.3), p = 0.02); breast (OR=8.6, 95%CI(1.03-71), p = 0.04), colon cancers (OR= 12, 95%CI(1.2-115), p =0.03). GT genotype was also associated significantly with colon cancer (OR=2.6, 95%CI (1.1-6), p =0.03). However SNP rs224176 was associated with only breast cancer. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that adiponectin gene SNP rs1501299 and SNP rs224176 may be the predisposing factors in some cancers but our results differ from what has been reported in other populations suggesting a complex relationship between genetic variations and phenotypic adiponectin levels.";"Al Khaldi RM|Al Mulla F|Al Awadhi S|Kapila K|Mojiminiyi OA";"Dis Markers. 2011 Jan 1;30(4):197-212."
"Trying to make it all come together': structuration and employed mothers' experience of family food provisioning in Canada";21693474;"http://heapro.oupjournals.org/";"Health promotion international";"This research examined the aetiology of employed mothers' food choice and food provisioning decisions using a qualitative, grounded theory methodology. Semi-structured interviews using the Food Choice Map were conducted with eleven middle-income employed mothers of elementary school-age children. Results demonstrated that the women exhibited conflicting identities with respect to food choice and provisioning. As 'good mothers' they were the primary food and nutrition caregivers for the family, desiring to provide healthy, homemade foods their families preferred at shared family meals. They also sought to be independent selves, working outside the home, within the context of a busy modern family. Increased food autonomy of children, and lack of time due to working outside the home and children's involvement in extracurricular activities, were significant influences on their food choice and provisioning. This resulted in frequently being unable to live up to their expectations of consistently providing healthy homemade foods and having shared family meals. To cope, the women frequently relied on processed convenience and fast foods despite their acknowledged inferior nutritional status. Using Giddens' structuration theory, the dynamic relationships between the women's food choice and provisioning actions, their identities and larger structures including socio-cultural norms, conditions of work and the industrial food system were explored. The ensuing dietary pattern of the women and their families increases the risk of poor health outcomes, including obesity. These results have implications for public health responses to improve population health by shifting the focus from individual-level maternal influences to structural influences on diet.";"Slater J|Sevenhuysen G|Edginton B|O'neil J";"Health Promot Int. 2011 Jun 21."
"The relevance of increased fat oxidation for body-weight management: metabolic inflexibility in the predisposition to weight gain";21692967;"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-789X";"Obesity Reviews";"Cells, tissues and organisms have the ability to rapidly switch substrate oxidation from carbohydrate to fat in response to changes in nutrient intake, and to changes in energy demands, environmental cues and internal signals. In healthy, metabolically normal individuals, substrate switching occurs rapidly and completely; in other words, substrate switching is 'flexible'. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that a blunted substrate switching from low- to high-fat oxidation exists in obese individuals, as well as in pre-obese and post-obese, and that this 'metabolic inflexibility' may be a genetically determined trait. A decreased fat oxidation can lead to a positive energy balance under conditions of high-fat feeding, due to depletion of glycogen stores that stimulates appetite and energy intake through glucostatic and glucogenostatic mechanisms, e.g. hepatic sensing of glycogen stores. Several genetic polymorphisms and single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified that are associated with low-fat oxidation rates and metabolic inflexibility, and genetic identification of susceptible individuals may lead to personalized prevention of weight gain using fat oxidation stimulants ('fat burners') in the future.";"Astrup A";"Obes Rev. 2011 Jun 21. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00894.x."
"Effects of Obesity and Gender on Exercise Capacity in Urban Children";21689992;"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/15508579";"Gender medecine";"BACKGROUND:
The prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity has been rising steadily over the last few decades and is now considered one of the most important issues worldwide.
OBJECTIVE:
The goal of this study was to investigate the influence of body mass on fitness in a healthy cohort of urban children and adolescents and to evaluate the difference in the cardiovascular responses, as measured by heart rate and endurance time, elicited with exercise in each gender.
METHODS:
This observational study was conducted in an exercise laboratory. Participants were healthy boys and girls aged 4 to 18 years. The study evaluated heart rate and endurance time during exercise testing on a treadmill. Outcome measures were endurance time and heart rate.
RESULTS:
The study comprised 303 boys and 222 girls ranging in age from 4 to 18 years (mean [SD], 12.2 [3.48] years). Obese children had a significantly lower endurance time than nonobese children (boys, P < 0.0001; girls, P = 0.0001). The mean (SEM) decrease in endurance time for obese versus nonobese children was 1.90 (0.38) minutes for boys and 1.52 (0.39) minutes for girls. A decrease in mean endurance time of 0.69 minute for each unit increase in BMI was noted. Obese boys and girls performed at a higher heart rate than their nonobese counterparts, although there was no statistically significant difference in maximum heart rate achieved by obese and nonobese children (boys, P = 0.71; girls, P = 0.79).
CONCLUSIONS:
Endurance time was significantly decreased in these obese boys and girls, and they performed at a higher heart rate earlier in exercise than nonobese children. There was no significant difference in maximum heart rate between obese and nonobese children.";"Ferns SJ|Wehrmacher WH|Serratto M";"Gend Med. 2011 Jun 18."
