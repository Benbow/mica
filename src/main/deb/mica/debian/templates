 Mica updates are ready to be applied:
 .
  1. Run update.php by visiting http://www.example.com/update.php (replace www.example.com with your domain name).
     This will update the database tables.
 .
     If you are unable to access update.php do the following:
       - Open /usr/share/mica/sites/default/settings.php with a text editor.
       - Find the line that says: pdate_free_access = FALSE;
       - Change it into: pdate_free_access = TRUE;
     Once the upgrade is done, pdate_free_access must be reverted to FALSE.
 .
  2. Go to Administration > Configuration > Development and clear all caches.
 .
  3. Go to Administration > Configuration > Development > Maintenance mode.
     Disable the 'Put site into maintenance mode' checkbox and save the configuration.
